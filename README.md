## Overview

This library provides an interface and implementation classes that build and maintain an (inverted, positional, zoned) [index](#invertedindex) for a collection of documents or `corpus` (see [definitions](#definitions)).

![Index construction flowchart](https://github.com/GM-Consult-Pty-Ltd/text_indexing/raw/main/assets/images/indexing.png?raw=true?raw=true "Index construction overview")

The [indexer](#textindexer) constructs three inverted `index` artifacts:
* the `dictionary` that holds the `vocabulary` of `terms` and the frequency of occurrence for each `term` in the `corpus`; 
* the `k-gram index` that maps `k-grams` to `terms` in the `dictionary`; and
* the `postings` index that holds a list of references to the `documents` for each `term` (the `postings list`). 

In this implementation, a `postings list` is a hashmap of the document id (`docId`) to maps that point to positions of the `term` in the document's `zones` (fields). This allows query algorithms to score and rank search results based on the position(s) of a term in document fields, applying different weights to the zones.

## Usage

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the `text_indexing` dependency.

```yaml
dependencies:
  text_indexing: <latest version>
```

In your code file add the `text_indexing` import.

```dart
import 'package:text_indexing/text_indexing.dart';
```

For small collections, instantiate a `TextIndexer.inMemory`, (optionally passing empty `Dictionary` and `Postings` hashmaps), then iterate over a collection of documents to add them to the index.

```dart
  // - initialize a in-memory [TextIndexer] with defaults for all parameters
  final indexer =TextIndexer.inMemory();

  // - iterate through the sample data
  await Future.forEach(documents.entries, (MapEntry<String, String> doc) async {
    // - index each document
    await indexer.index(doc.key, doc.value);
  });
```

The [examples](https://pub.dev/packages/text_indexing/example) demonstrate the use of the `TextIndexer.inMemory` and  `TextIndexer.async` factories.

## API

The [API](https://pub.dev/documentation/text_indexing/latest/) exposes the [TextIndexer] interface that builds and maintains an [InvertedIndex] for a collection of documents.

To maximise performance of the indexers the API performs lookups on nested hashmaps of DART core types rather than defining strongly typed object models. To improve code legibility the API makes use of type aliases throughout.

### InvertedIndex

The [InvertedIndexMixin] implements the  implements the [InvertedIndex.getTfIndex], [InvertedIndex.getFtdPostings] and [InvertedIndex.getIdFtIndex] methods, while three implementation classes are provided: 
* the [InMemoryIndex] class is intended for fast indexing of a smaller corpus using in-memory dictionary, k-gram and postings hashmaps;
* the [AsyncCallbackIndex] is intended for working with a larger corpus and an asynchronous index repository in persisted storage.  It uses asynchronous callbacks to perform read and write operations on `dictionary`, `k-gram` and `postings` repositories; and
* the [CachedIndex] is intended for working with a larger corpus with an asynchronous index repository in persisted storage.  It uses asynchronous callbacks to perform read and write operations on [Dictionary], [KGramIndex] and [Postings] repositories, but keeps a cache of the most popular terms and k-grams in memory for faster indexing and searching. 

### TextIndexer

The [TextIndexer] is an nterface for classes that construct and maintain a dictionary, inverted, positional, zoned index and k-gram index  for a `corpus`. 

Text or documents can be indexed by calling the following methods:
* [TextIndexer.indexText] indexes text from a text document;
* [TextIndexer.indexJson] indexes the fields in a `JSON` document; and 
* [TextIndexer.indexCollection] indexes the fields of all the documents in a JSON document collection.

Use the factory constructor to instantiate a [TextIndexer] with the index of your choice or extend [TextIndexerBase].

## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/text_indexing/latest/):

* `corpus`- the collection of `documents` for which an `index` is maintained.
* `character filter` - filters characters from text in preparation of tokenization.  
* `dictionary` - is a hash of `terms` (`vocabulary`) to the frequency of occurence in the `corpus` documents.
* `document` - a record in the `corpus`, that has a unique identifier (`docId`) in the `corpus`'s primary key and that contains one or more text fields that are indexed.
* `index` - an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) used to look up `document` references from the `corpus` against a `vocabulary` of `terms`. 
* `document frequency (dFt)` is number of documents in the `corpus` that contain a term.
* `index-elimination` - selecting a subset of the entries in an index where the `term` is in the collection of `terms` in a search phrase.
* `inverse document frequency` or `iDft` is equal to log (N / `dft`), where N is the total number of terms in the index. The `IdFt` of a rare term is high, whereas the [IdFt] of a frequent term is likely to be low. 
* `JSON` is an acronym for `"Java Script Object Notation"`, a common format for persisting data.
`k-gram` - a sequence of (any) k consecutive characters from a `term`. A k-gram can start with "$", dentoting the start of the [Term], and end with "$", denoting the end of the [Term]. The 3-grams for "castle" are { $ca, cas, ast, stl, tle, le$ }.
* `lemmatizer` - lemmatisation (or lemmatization) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)).
* `postings` - a separate index that records which `documents` the `vocabulary` occurs in. In this implementation we also record the positions of each `term` in the `text` to create a positional inverted `index`.
* `postings list` - a record of the positions of a `term` in a `document`. A position of a `term` refers to the index of the `term` in an array that contains all the `terms` in the `text`.
* `term` - a word or phrase that is indexed from the `corpus`. The `term` may differ from the actual word used in the corpus depending on the `tokenizer` used.
* `term filter` - filters unwanted terms from a collection of terms (e.g. stopwords), breaks compound terms into separate terms and / or manipulates terms by invoking a `stemmer` and / or `lemmatizer`.
* `stemmer` -  stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming)).
* `stopwords` - common words in a language that are excluded from indexing.
* `term frequency (Ft)` is the frequency of a `term` in an index or indexed object.
* `term position` is the zero-based index of a `term` in an ordered array of `terms` tokenized from the `corpus`.
* `text` - the indexable content of a `document`.
* `token` - representation of a `term` in a text source returned by a `tokenizer`. The token may include information about the `term` such as its position(s) (`term position`) in the text or frequency of occurrence (`term frequency`).
* `token filter` - returns a subset of `tokens` from the tokenizer output.
* `tokenizer` - a function that returns a collection of `token`s from `text`, after applying a character filter, `term` filter, [stemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and / or [lemmatizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).
* `vocabulary` - the collection of `terms` indexed from the `corpus`.
