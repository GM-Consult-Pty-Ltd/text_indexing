///   index vocabulary also contains phrases up to [phraseLength] long,
///   concatenated from consecutive terms. The index size is increased by a
///   factor of [phraseLength];
/// - [analyzer] is the [ITextAnalyzer] used to index the corpus terms;
/// - [vocabularyLength] is the number of unique terms in the corpus;
/// - [zones] is a hashmap of zone names to their relative weight in the index;
/// - [getDictionary] retrieves a [Dictionary] for a collection of [Term]s from
///   the in-memory [dictionary] hashmap;
/// - [upsertDictionary ] inserts entries into the in-memory [dictionary] hashmap,
///   overwriting any existing entries;
/// - [getPostings] retrieves [Postings] for a collection of [Term]s from the
///   in-memory [postings] hashmap;
