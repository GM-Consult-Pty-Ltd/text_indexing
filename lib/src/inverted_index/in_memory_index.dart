/// - [phraseLength] is the maximum length of phrases in the index vocabulary.
///   The minimum phrase length is 1. If phrase length is greater than 1, the
///   index vocabulary also contains phrases up to [phraseLength] long,
///   concatenated from consecutive terms. The index size is increased by a
///   factor of [phraseLength];
/// - [analyzer] is the [ITextAnalyzer] used to tokenize text for the index;
/// - [vocabularyLength] is the number of unique terms in the corpus;
/// - [zones] is a hashmap of zone names to their relative weight in the index;
/// - [k] is the length of k-gram entries in the k-gram index;
/// - [getDictionary] retrieves a [Dictionary] for a collection of [Term]s from
///   the in-memory [dictionary] hashmap;
/// - [upsertDictionary ] inserts entries into the in-memory [dictionary] hashmap,
///   overwriting any existing entries;
/// - [getKGramIndex] Asynchronously retrieves a [KGramIndex] for a collection
///   of [KGram]s from a [KGramIndex] repository;
/// - [upsertKGramIndex ] inserts entries into a [KGramIndex] repository,
///   overwriting any existing entries;
/// - [getPostings] retrieves [Postings] for a collection of [Term]s from the
///   in-memory [postings] hashmap;
/// - [upsertPostings] inserts entries into the in-memory [postings] hashmap,
///   overwriting any existing entries;
/// - [getFtdPostings] return a [FtdPostings] for a collection of [Term]s from
/// the [Postings], optionally filtered by minimum term frequency; and
/// - [getIdFtIndex] returns a [IdFtIndex] for a collection of [Term]s from
/// the [Dictionary].
/// - [dictionary] is the in-memory term dictionary for the indexer. Pass a
///   [dictionary] instance at instantiation, otherwise an empty [Dictionary]
///   will be initialized; and
/// - [postings] is the in-memory postings hashmap for the indexer. Pass a
