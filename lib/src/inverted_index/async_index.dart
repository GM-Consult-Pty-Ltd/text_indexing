/// The [AsyncCallbackIndex] is a [InvertedIndex] implementation class

/// - [phraseLength] is the maximum length of phrases in the index vocabulary.
///   The minimum phrase length is 1. If phrase length is greater than 1, the
///   index vocabulary also contains phrases up to [phraseLength] long,
///   concatenated from consecutive terms. The index size is increased by a
///   factor of [phraseLength];
/// - [analyzer] is the [ITextAnalyzer] used to tokenize text for the index;
/// - [vocabularyLength] is the number of unique terms in the corpus;
/// - [zones] is a hashmap of zone names to their relative weight in the index;
/// - [k] is the length of k-gram entries in the k-gram index;
/// - [getDictionary] Asynchronously retrieves a [Dictionary] for a collection
///   of [Term]s from a [Dictionary] repository;
/// - [upsertDictionary ] inserts entries into a [Dictionary] repository,
