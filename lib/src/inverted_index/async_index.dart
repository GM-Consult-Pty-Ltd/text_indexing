/// The [AsyncCallbackIndex] is a [InvertedIndex] implementation class
/// that uses asynchronous callbacks to perform read and write operations on
/// [Dictionary] and [Postings] repositories:
/// - [phraseLength] is the maximum length of phrases in the index vocabulary.
///   The minimum phrase length is 1. If phrase length is greater than 1, the
///   index vocabulary also contains phrases up to [phraseLength] long,
///   concatenated from consecutive terms. The index size is increased by a
///   factor of [phraseLength];
/// - [analyzer] is the [ITextAnalyzer] used to index the corpus terms;
/// - [vocabularyLength] is the number of unique terms in the corpus;
/// - [getDictionary] Asynchronously retrieves a [Dictionary] for a collection
///   of [Term]s from a [Dictionary] repository;
/// - [upsertDictionary ] inserts entries into a [Dictionary] repository,
///   overwriting any existing entries;
/// - [getPostings] asynchronously retrieves [Postings] for a collection
///   of [Term]s from a [Postings] repository;
/// - [upsertPostings] inserts entries into a [Postings] repository,
///   overwriting any existing entries;
/// - [getFtdPostings] return a [FtdPostings] for a collection of [Term]s from
/// the [Postings], optionally filtered by minimum term frequency; and
/// - [getIdFtIndex] returns a [IdFtIndex] for a collection of [Term]s from
/// the [Dictionary].
/// - [dictionaryLoader] asynchronously retrieves a [Dictionary] for a vocabulary
///   from a data source;
/// - [dictionaryLengthLoader] asynchronously retrieves the number of terms in
///   the vocabulary (N);
/// - [dictionaryUpdater] is callback that passes a [Dictionary] subset
///    for persisting to a datastore;
/// - [postingsLoader] asynchronously retrieves a [Postings] for a vocabulary
///   from a data source; and
/// - [postingsUpdater] passes a [Postings] subset for persisting to a
///   datastore.
